# Arial Search and Rescue Development Platform

## How It Started
Hi! In 2023, I decided I wanted to make an autonomous Search and Rescue drone. I have flown drones since the original DJI Phantom 1 came out in 2012. I have alwasy loved flying them. I started by watching my Dad fly his drone when he first got one. I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. Over time, he would sometimes let me fly his drones to propbably get me to stop asking so much. As the years went on, I continued to fly drones with my Dad for fun, for photography and video jobs, and to just try out some new tech. I eventually got to a point where I was flying these on my own and doing my own jobs with it. Noramally it was just getting a few photos and videos for my school and some buisnesses. I decided to branch out as time went on to professional photography, videography, cinematrography, and location mapping/analysis. Sometimes I would help my Dad with his Search and Rescue jobs that he got.

Fast forward a few more years, I have my own small arsenal of drones ranging froma  few inches in diameter to a few feet. I pretty much have a drone for anything I could ever need. Since technology was always advancing, especially in the Search and Rescue/Police feild, I was wanting for something similar to the cool thermal and tracking tech that they had. My Dad had a thermal camera he used to use on one of his older drones, and I was just given access to a little bit of money from my Highschool for a new Senior Project test class they were running. What I decided to do was to attempt to make a autonomous Search and Rescue drone that could both find, alerty, and assist a person in need. That's where the idea started anyway.

## First Attempt

### Software Testing
First, I needed a drone to get the job done. The drones I had at the time were either too small, or were larger but designed only for specific payloads. I wanted something modular and with the ability to add your own components and integrate them into the drone's flight controller. I went looking online and came across a drone from DJI called the Matric 100. It was a mid to larger size drone with the ability to run multiple battery packs and add your own payloads. It was a great base for my needs. Next I needed the hardware for my payload. My school gave me a rough budget of about $100 that I could spend on components to achieve what I wanted to do. I decided to save my budget a little and start off with a Raspberry Pi 3b that my school already had. At the time I was unsure of how much GPU power Object Recognition needed to work at a decent speed, so I assumed it was enough. I was greatly mistaken. I found a few videos online on how to use Object Recognition on a Raspberryi Pi that were somewhat easy to understand. What held me back was my lack of knowledge on how to use Linux based operating systems. A lot of time was spent fixing random errors I was getting by looking up the problems online and trying to understand what they were. It took a bit of effort to get it all working, but eventually I had some luck.

Once I had the software working and an old Logitech camera plugged into the Pi's USB port, I finally had an image on the screen. While it certainly was recognizing me and a few objects I had around my room, it was very limited with its speed. I was hitting a whopping three to four frames per second. I was so happy it worked, but I knew this would not realistic to use in the field. I went back to my advisor for the class and asked if I could buy a Rapsberry Pi 4b to run to a bit faster. From what I knew at the time, it was signifigantly more powerful in the GPU department. He said yes, I found a good ebay listing for one, and had it within the week. After reloading everything onto the new Pi and trying again, I was hitting about fifteen FPS which was more than usable. What I needed now was a way to use my thermal camera's video stream instead of my USB camera. I found out I needed to buy a USB Capture Card to convert my thermal camera's HDMI output to a USB input that the Pi could understand. I found a cheap one at my local Micro Center and tried it when I got back home. It worked perfectly. While the pre-made model for the detection was not designed for thermal images, it worked quite well for detecting people. I then had a good idea of what needed to get done to finish this proof of concept.
