Hi! My name is Matthew Wilkins and this is my own personal site where I'll talk about pretty much anything that comes to mind. I'll talk about cool projects I have been working on, some cool tech I see in the world, and pretty much anything else. Think of it as a way to keep up with my thoughts and ideas.

Hopefully you may get some enjoyment out of this. Maybe it could inspire you to do some projects or look into some of the cool tech we have here on Earth. Who knows.
